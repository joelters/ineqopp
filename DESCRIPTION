Description: Estimates Inequality of Opportunity (IOp) in several ways. Debiased IOp
  estimates can be computed using any Machine Learner among: Lasso, Ridge, Random Forest, Conditional
  Inferest Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Catboosting or some combination
  of these five machine learners. Plug in estimates can also be computed estimating the
  fitted values with a log linear regression, non-parametrically (for discrete circumstances)
  or with any of the aforementioned machine learners. Debiased partial effects can
  also be computed. The package includes a survey with income and circumstances for
  Madrid in 2018 (from Encuesta de Condiciones de vida (ECV) 2019).
